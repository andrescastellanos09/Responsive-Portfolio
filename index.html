		<h1>About Me</h1>
	
		<img src="assets/images/Profile pic.jpg" width="200" class="Profile Pic">

		<p>I was born in Colombia, came to Orlando when I was 15 and have been living the dream since then. I am a former business owner looking for a new path in life. I have been successful at what I did, but nothing makes me feel the way I do when I create something. I believe I was born to be an artist and web development makes me feel like Picasso.I have experience in the business world and learned to do basically everything from top to bottom, so I know what it takes to become successful! Hard work and dedication are always part of the formula to succeed in anything we do. I am a graduate from Seminole State College with a Bachelor of Science in Business and Information Management, I became a web developer because I wanted to complement my degree. I acquired many business skills; however, the technical knowledge caught my attention and I became a fan of business inteligence, information technology and web development. My greatest skill is my desire to learn and master what I learn.
